Q1) what is the difference between Geo redundant storage (GRS)and Zone redundant storage(ZRS)

 If our storage account is configured  to GRS,if primary region fails then we can get backup from secondary region.
 If our storage account is configured  to ZRS ,if data center fails in one zone of a region then we can get back up from other zone of the same region.

Q1)As storage account can have multiple containers,on Storage Account we have Read Access only, container level we have write access. so can i access the data in the container?

No we can't get write access to containers has storage account access has high priority than any other storage type which is only read access in this case.
